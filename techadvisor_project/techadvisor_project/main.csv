For an extra £20 it adds 4G LTE connectivity and a front-facing camera, plus performance and storage improvements. It might not be as fast as the grey-market Doogee F1 Turbo Mini, but this Moto E 4G is a much better deal than the EE Kestrel, making it the best budget 4G phone intended for UK sale we've seen.",,,

The lack of user friendliness, in particular, could be improved upon. However, many of the LBP6230dw's faults are common to most other affordable laser printers. And many of them are minor issues which will cause few problems on an everyday basis. And there is a lot, an awful lot, that the Canon does incredibly well. It's highly affordable to both buy and run, and has searing speed and quality for this price-point. It's also pleasingly compact. For a discreet page-churner that you can entrust your daily workload to, the LBP6230dw is a fantastic product for the money.",,,

The voice search works well too, and Alexa is coming, which will make it far better. The interface is slick and easy to use, even if it can be confusing working out what you can watch on an Amazon Prime subscription. The Fire TV is one of the best video streamers, but it really makes sense if you pair it with a Prime Instant Video subscription and use Amazon's other services. 4K content at no extra cost is a huge bonus but don't forget that many 4K TVs already have the Prime Instant Video app. This means it's going to appeal to people who want 4K Prime Instant Video (or Netflix) but their TV doesn't have it.

We think paying extra for the PLP1200 is worth it as it boasts a pass-through socket compared to the less flexible PL1000. While found lacking in features, it will still make a huge difference to your home network and PC/entertainment download speeds. The price is reasonable, but you can get cheaper (but not quite as fast) with a 500Mbps Powerline. ",,,

Adding a second Wi-Fi hotspot in your home is a welcome addition to the much faster wired speeds you’ll enjoy when downloading HD movies or playing games over the Internet.

We think the S7 is worth the extra if you’ll use the extra features it offers over the 3T.

It's just a shame about the battery life. Read our Dell Precision M3800 review to find out more.","The Precision M3800 is Dell’s take on the ‘Ultrabook’ portable workstation notebook. It’s made from a mixture of materials, and has an undersized battery in order to stay fashionably trim. In its favour, the quad-core processor and midrange pro-certified graphics chipset provide useful performance, and without too much histrionics from the cooling fans. This year’s model now has a UHD 4K display although this still serves to exaggerate problems in some Windows programs, while the overly reflective touchscreen facility results in a heavier panel with poorer viewing that drains the battery faster. For professional users even more so than with consumer laptops, we here question the real worth of a touchscreen on a laptop. Ultimately the Dell’s circa-3 hour battery life means the M3800 is seriously compromised as a mobile productivity tool.

But which should you get? Read our AMD Radeon R9 280X vs nVidia GeForce GTX 770 graphics card comparison review to find out.","The decision over which GPU to choose will come down largely to money. Neither GPU offers much in the way of new technology (although the Mantle support on the 280X might prove a significant innovation in years to come), but the GTX 770 is less power-intensive, and operates more quietly. Crucially, it's also a faster GPU, even if there isn't usually more than a few frames in it. So price becomes the crucial issue. The MSI GTX 770 ends up being the cheapest of all cards, making this the best buy. In truth, though, if there's a difference in price of less than £20, the GTX 770 is the product to have. There would be a slight concern about the memory, and the 3GB of the 280X is likely to look better two years from now. But assuming you're not looking to run games with multi-monitors, the memory is unlikely to be a killer. The GTX 770, then, looks the slightly better deal.

Read our Gigabyte GeForce GTX 780 Ti review to find out why.,"In many respects, the nVidia GeForce GTX 780 Ti is the best out there. It's got the best specifications and produces astounding frame rates in real-world gaming. It's also relatively quiet next to the 290X. Having said all that, we'd still recommend the 290X to most users. That's because there's a £160 price gap which, in our opinion, isn't quite bridged by the Ti's superiority. For the time being it remains just that bit too expensive to take the recommendation as best value high-end card. However, if money is no object, this is the best single-GPU gaming card out there. And when the price falls so that the difference between this and the 290X drops to two figures, the 780 Ti will almost undoubtedly become the top high-performance deal on the market.",,,

Is it worth paying more for the GTX 770? Here's our GTX 760 vs GTX 770 graphics card comparison, with GTX 760 vs GTX 770 specifications, benchmarks and buying advice.","The GTX 770 is around £50 more than the 760, so you would expect it to be faster. But how fast does it need to be to justify that price difference. Well, in our opinion, you should only be opting for the 760 instead if you either have an absolute price limit of around the £200 mark, or if it's vital that the card is extremely power efficient. The 760 fares very well in terms of wattage, although it's not noticeably quieter than the 770. Otherwise, the 770 is most definitely worth the extra £50. The difference in performance isn't small. The 770 was frequently between 20 and 25% faster, and some times the gap was bigger still. You're not getting the very latest features, but that's not what the 770 is about. If you want raw performance, the 770 is a strong contender. There is also the question of extra memory. At around £250-£260, the 770 is a well priced product that will give you two or three years of strong service. By that time, there'll be something better that's suitably priced as an upgrade. Once you bolt on 4GB, though, and push the price beyond the £300 mark, you're starting to make it a pricey proposition. If you're looking to play with multiple screens, or if you'll want the card to still be a strong performer in 2016/2017, you'll need to add the extra memory. For most users, though, the 2GB GTX 770 is great value for money.",,,

But are they worth the money, and which is best? Find out in our nVidia GTX 760 vs Radeon HD 7950 comparison review.","The 7950 isn't a very easy card to find at the moment. That's probably intentional on AMD's part, as the company knows that the 7950 really can't compete with the 760. Even if the 7950 is available for around £200, it's an inferior product when it comes to gaming. The 760 turns an advantage in most tests. It's not usually a very big one, but 10 - 15% is typical, especially at lower resolutions. That means the 7950 would have to be available for around the £160/£170 mark in order to be competitive. The 760 gives you a very solid leap forwards. If you're looking to upgrade, we would recommend spending a little more on the 770, but the 760 will do the job. The 760 is also pretty quiet, and very low on power, making it a very good choice for modest systems. We would, though, warn against the 4GB version. There's simply no need for the extra memory. You're not going to use the 760 for the sort of demanding game setups that require 4GB. By 2016, it might be that graphics cards need the extra memory to properly handle the latest games. But the 760 will be looking distinctly jaded by then, so you're better off trying to spend a sum just above £200 on a 760, and then looking to upgrade it in a couple of years time.",,,

In terms of performance, though, there's no question that the R9 290X cruises past its similarly-priced rival. The card is loud and furious, but it romps through the benchmarks, beating even the Titan in the majority of tests - despite that card costing considerably more. We'll be interested to see what AMD can do about producing a more efficient and quieter card in the future that can produce speed close to that of the 290X.

What you get onscreen here in terms of detail and dynamics is terrific for the price. While the HD30 is probably less refined than it should be when it comes to overall usability, home-cinema fans and high-end gamers will not be disappointed by its visual performance.

Perfect for kids bedrooms, sporting events and large-walled living spaces, its huge images are easy to enjoy. The standard-definition Freeview TV tuner though is a misstep.

For that price you get a Mac that is fine for everyday tasks but a little slow for more labour-intensive jobs like editing photos and videos, but it’s still capable of that too. The two slightly pricier iMacs are much faster, although the top-end model isn’t that much speedier than the mid-range model.

I am an Android user, and would take the Samsung Galaxy Tab S 8.4's larger, higher-resolution screen, more compact size and weight, potentially faster performance, micro-USB port, better cameras and fingerprint scanner over anything the iPad mini has to offer. But if you are a fan of Apple's devices, the software alone may make this decision for you.",,,

The use of Gigabit Ethernet, plus the new Powerline chips, and the clever “Range+” technology make these adapters stand out from the now quite established 500Mbps adapters. They’re not massively faster than the older adapters but they are an improvement. The lack of Wi-Fi on these adapters is, however, a disappointment.

If you need the three Ethernet ports we still prefer Devolo's dLAN 500AV Wireless+. Even though they're a bit slower the inclusion of Wi-Fi makes them better value.

Here's our Gladiator Firestorm OC review.,"While it lacks the more petit dimensions of the gaming PCs in our recent compact system group test, this Gladiator PC is still reasonably small when compared to a standard gaming PC system. It's fairly quiet, and relatively conservative on power consumption when gaming. It doesn't have the fancy hardware of some compact PCs, but it can make a good job of games at lower 720p resolutions, along with huge processing potential for regular Windows work. It may lose in the compact, discreet gaming category but at £695 it’s a decently priced part-time gamer PC.",,,

There are better alternatives for around the same £500 price, even Windows 8 all-in-ones that offer better performance; or you can get a higher quality standalone display for much less money. Android doesn't work well at this screen size, apps look terrible and the hardware isn't powerful enough to provide a smooth experience.

Here we put Adobe's Photoshop Elements 13 and CyberLink PhotoDirector 6 head to head to find out which is the best budget photo editing program.","PhotoDirector 6 Ultra certainly has some powerful photo-editing tools, but it doesn’t always present them in a manner that would be accessible to less experienced users. Its Photo Merge options are very similar to those of Photoshop Elements, but you’ll need to put in a bit more work to learn how to use these tools effectively.

The larger, 7-inch, Ultra XDi has twice the storage as the 5-inch LeapPad 3 but younger children may prefer the 3's smaller size and weight. We think their upper-age range is six or seven rather than Leapfrog's claimed nine, but our eight-year-old tester still enjoyed her time with both. While the hardware is cheaper than normal tablets note that the software can be more expensive. The advantage of Leapfrog software is that, while not as cheap as normal mobile apps, it has been built by educational PhDs with both fun and learning in mind. With its white-list web browsing it's safer online than most adult tablets, although it's limited in its scope from that point of view. The LeapPads are bestsellers every year and the latest models build on an award-winning and popular formula without any huge leaps forward in terms of design or functionality.

Find out what is the best small tablet in our Xperia Z3 Tablet Compact vs iPad Mini with Retina Display comparison.,"Considering that it is last year's product, the iPad mini with Retina Display is hanging in there. We prefer the Sony, principally because it is more powerful, thinner and lighter, has a better camera and - glory be - it's cheaper. But the iPad mini remains a stunning device, and for those that prefer Apple it won't be a let down.",,,

Here's our Chord Electronics Hugo review.","The Hugo has several usability issues which many sound-first users may be willing to work through, although we feel it could be a more universally loved product if addressed. For computer audiophiles especially, but also used alongside traditional non-PC digital sources, the sound quality is quite literally a revelation. While erring towards the light and bright side of neutrality and perhaps not even to every ear or system's taste, the Hugo covers the full musical range majestically with a performance even more colourful than its multicoloured LED lightshow. That it can be used as a portable headphone DAC with the finest high-resolution recordings available, simply plugged into an iPhone while away from home, is a startling breakthrough.",,,

The case adds bulk to the slimline phone but does offer robust protection. Its companion products – the circular Charging Pad, and Charging Car Mount – expand the product’s usefulness in the home and in the car.

Here's our review of the Nokia Lumia 630.","If you're considering the Lumia 630 as a first smartphone and you don't plan to buy lots of wireless accessories and install lots of apps, it's not a bad choice at all. Windows Phone 8.1 is very easy to use, and will improve even more when Cortana and its associated features arrive in the UK.

That latter card will probably be falling from the market before long. Until it does, though, it's a much better deal overall than the 250.",,,

If your requirements are more stringent the figures represent something of a mixed bag. Photographers will be drawn by the good gamut and the colour accuracy and, while the contrast ratio could be better, this should fit the bill for less demanding users.

The ThinkPad's processor performance is fractionally faster thanks to its 0.1 GHz advantage over the latter, but the overall choice of CPU, operating system and display together compromise the X1 Carbon's battery life to provide less than half that of what's possible. In its favour, the X1 Carbon has better screen image quality and a characterful keyboard that can command a loyal following. Ultimately, the X1 Carbon looks overpriced and more cheaply constructed than the MacBook Air, and moreover loses out against the more affordable MacBook Pro with Retina display.",,,

The Xperia Z3 Tablet Compact is super thin and light and is waterproof to boot. Hardware is decent but not mind-blowing and while rivals like the Galaxy Tab S offer a bit more gadgetry, Sony offers High-Res audio and a killer feature for gamers in the form of PS4 Remote Play.

For entertainment, web browsing, email, social networks, games, photography and video, the iPad wins. It's also a lot cheaper than the Surface Pro 3. A lot. If you need a tablet that's also a fully-fledged laptop on which you can run business software, your only option among the two devices here is the Surface Pro 3. Kind of obvious, really. But it bears thinking about: if you don't want two devices - a laptop and a tablet - the Surface Pro 3 is the best choice at the moment. It's not cheap, for sure, but it has the big screen, surprisingly slim dimensions and weight and will comfortably run any Windows software you care to install.",,,

This comparison is based on lengthy testing of the HTC One M8, and on the known specs of the as-yet unseen Nexus 6. Given the limitations of this, we can still say some things for certain. As you would expect from an older handset the HTC One M8 will be cheaper than is the Nexus 6. And it is a great phone.

It offers somewhere to store the headset while you're not using it, and helps you monitor your sleep and activity as a bonus. The poor step-counting accuracy is very disappointing though, as is battery life. In fact, this is one of the least polished activity trackers we've tried.

It's generally faster than the Radeon, particularly at the lower resolutions you're likely to use these cards with. There's also plenty of overclocking potential, and the gap will only increase as the clock speeds are pushed up. The 970 consumes relatively little power, and represents the best deal.",,,

This is a classic case of picking the feature set that best suits your needs, rather than spending more to get more if it is overkill. Existing Fitbit users will likely upgrade to the Charge HR.

Well, the 980 is the best single-GPU solution out there (watch out for more high-end comparisons), and will provide you with as much power as you need from one card.

For typical gamers, the 970 will more than suffice, and is a better alternative to the Radeon R9 290X. Don't discount the 780 Ti, as this is faster than the 970, and can be bought for only a small amount extra. However, assuming that one becomes unavailable, the 970 is the best mid-price option.

Of course it is. After all, it's twice the price of the Lumia 735. In its screen, in its hardware, in its storage, in fact in every category the HTC beats the Nokia. But while the HTC clearly has the better selfie camera tech, you could argue that Nokia's selfie software is easier to use without going too far and, given the lower price, we reckon it'll be more appealing to its target market.

It’s a very good-looking, stylish smartwatch – something that’s a rarity in the smartwatch industry.

The Moto 360 has a button disguised as a crown which is used to turn the display on and off, as well an ambient light sensor that automatically adjusts screen brightness dependent on your lighting conditions. Ambient light sensors are a feature that smartwatches need, but very few have. It also has an optical heart rate monitor that periodically checks your pulse in the background without being prompted to, and without a need to physically interact with the watch.

ViewSonic's warranty is useful with its zero dead-pixel warranty, making the VP2780-4K an accessible UHD monitor for professionals that don't need full Adobe RGB colour gamut and are working on a tight budget.",,,
Piper nv ,https://www.techadvisor.com/review/piper-nv-review-3607993/,,"The Piper nv is an interesting blend of home security and home automation that might be all your home needs. The built in night vision, 105db siren and live video streaming capabilities are just a handful of features that this device boasts. Want to know more? Read on and find out more.","The big question is ‘is the Piper nv worth the money?’ and in a word, yes, it is. The first generation Piper classic was a good entry into the home automation/home security industry, but it was lacking in several areas, mainly with regards to the camera capabilities.

The camera quality is great, even when streamed over 4G, the night vision delivers a clear picture and it does what it says on the tin.

We've tested both the Galaxy S5 and the HTC One M8 to help you decide to which to buy in 2014. Here's our Galaxy S5 vs HTC One M8 smartphone comparison review.","The Galaxy S5 is fast, well built, full featured. It has a big bright and bold screen, and good cameras, and it offers good storage- and connectivity options. And you could say all of the above about the new 2014 HTC One M8. The Galaxy S5 may offer a better, marginally bigger display, the HTC One M8 may be slightly faster, although you will be hard pressed to notice the difference in either area. Both phones offer interesting new features, and offer their maker's take on the latest Android. Ultimately availability and pricing will determine this battle, as well as the human and subjective response to design, build and interface. If it was me, at this stage I'd probably err toward the HTC One M8. But it really is a personal choice. And both of these phones are a great deal right now - set to get better.",,,$550

Here's our full and in-depth EE Rook review.,"If you don't mind the basic design, the EE Rook isn't a bad little phone at all. We can hardly argue with the price of £39 for existing customers and the performance is better than we expected for a sub-£50 phone.

Here's our Lenovo ThinkPad X250 review.","Lenovo has successfully shrunk its standard business notebook down to what was once known as the sub-notebook category, and is now a more commonplace size as laptops benefit from the push toward miniaturisation. Its Broadwell-generation Core i5 processor maintains performance for office duties and helps preserve usable runtime of almost 7 hours from its minimal 24Wh battery. Ergonomics are good thanks to the familiar dished-key keyboard and an option for IPS display. It may fall short of competitors like the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Retina display in terms of screen quality, price, longevity and sheer performance, but for business users that demand a trackpoint interface, smart card slot or TPM module, the ThinkPad X250 has all the right business credentials.",,,

If you want 4G data on the go for simple tasks then the Vodafone Tab Prime 6 isn't a bad choice with the PAYG option.

Here's our AOC U2868PQU review.,"The AOC U2868PQU offers a glimpse of UHD possibilities at around half the price of the current IPS and VA technology competition. But it is in some respects only half the monitor. In its favour it has fairly decent colour gamut and contrast ratio, and better than terrible viewing angles. It is more costly to run, has poorer colour accuracy, and judged subjectively we felt even after adjustment that image quality was clearly behind that found on IPS screens, admittedly at nearly half their price. We can’t see any sensible gamers getting excited about this panel though, since it would require dual top-of-the-range graphics cards to drive it to usable framerates. And anyone who can afford those will sorely be looking for a higher quality display than the budget U2968PQU.",,,

Find out in our Hudl 2 vs Nexus 9 comparison review.","There are many things to like about both products, but we feel there is a tangible difference between their focus. The Hudl 2 is an excellent, affordable entry point to the world of tablets and Android. The colourful livery, movie friendly screen size, and parental controls make it a good choice for those wanting a device to give to their children. At £99 it’s a lot less of a risk than an iPad or indeed the Nexus 9. Of course it’s still a fully functional tablet, so you don’t need to give it away to the youngsters, and if your primary uses would be browsing and media consumption then the Hudl 2 would make a great companion device. The Nexus 9 has more serious aspirations. Internally it’s stacked with impressive kit, while the outer shell is smart and a tad more mature. It feels far more like an attempt to emulate Apple’s larger iPad, sharing the same screen dimensions and quality construction. At three times the price of the Hudl 2, it’s not really true that you get three times the capability, but the package as a whole is impressive, solid, and one of the best you can get on the Android side of the fence.",,,

Samsung Galaxy S6 vs iPhone 6 Plus comparison,https://www.techadvisor.com/review/samsung-galaxy-s6-vs-iphone-6-plus-comparison-3620549/,,Which smartphone should you buy? The best Android or the best iPhone? We explain how these two titans compare and which is best for you in our Samsung Galaxy S6 vs iPhone 6 Plus comparison,"It’s virtually impossible to pick a winner here, as both are fantastic phones. Choosing between them is difficult, unless you have a specific need for a feature which is available only on one phone, or if you’re already tied into either iOS or Android because of other devices you own such as smart home gadgets which only offer apps for one system (typically iOS). Your choice will also dictate which smartwatch you can use: currently it’s Android-with-Android and Apple-with-Apple and no crossover.
The S6 is smaller and has a few quirky features – the on-demand heart-rate sensor isn’t a good enough reason to choose it over the iPhone though.
Samsung’s phone is quite a bit cheaper on contract, so this will make it the obvious choice for some, while others will want it because of its great camera.
Because of its size, many see the iPhone 6 Plus as the worse of the two current flagship iPhones, but we like the big screen for watching videos, browsing the web and even editing the occasional document.

There's also Google Play Music, Deezer, Rdio and Pandora vying for your ears. Read our Apple Music vs Spotify comparison review to find out which is best for you.","Music streaming is maturing nicely, and the wealth of choice available to customers at the moment is truly impressive. Apple Music has made a good start, with enough content to satisfy even the most picky audiophile. We liked Beats 1, although we’re not sure how long it will be before the novelty wears off. The app is clean, reasonably easy to move around in, and offers enough new and tailored music to keep you coming back for more. The excellent value Family plan is the real draw, especially is you have teenagers in the house and a few iOS devices, plus the three month trial is a nice touch. If we had to choose one platform though it would be Spotify. We like the interface, with its easy access to key features, and it generally feels more developed. The playlists are excellent and plentiful, with the social media component adding a deeper dimension. Cross platform support gives it a real edge, even though Apple Music will appear on Android at some point in the next few months. In the single membership plan it seems to us that you get better value, but Spotify can’t compete with the excellent family plan that Apple offers, and we fear this might be a significant feature in the battle for hearts and wallets. For now though we still think Spotify is the superior platform, but of course you can decide for yourself by signing up to those free trials.",,,$9.99 per month

We review the HP ZBook 15u G2.","Hewlett Packard has done well to build a lighter weight 15-inch mobile workstation laptop with much of the strength and integrity of its traditional models that are far less mobile in real terms. Sacrifices have been made to the main CPU by fitting dual-core rather than quad-core, and the AMD GPU is a middleweight part rather than fire-breathing FirePro. But importantly the 15u runs cool and quiet enough not make itself a nuisance, even under load. Assuming the version we tested will cost under £2000 it could provide decent value, majoring on resilience more than style and sheer performance, but well enough equipped to prove attractive to the target professional audience.",,,

We’re very fond of just about every aspect of the Galaxy Note 5, from its curved and sleek design to its vibrant display and high-resolution camera. It can handle almost anything you can throw at it thanks to its CPU, GPU and 4GB of RAM and we experienced no lag during our testing. The only bad point is that the Note 5 would sometimes falsely detect the S Pen detaching – and to point out such a minor fault says a lot about the quality of the handset.

The Spardar Smart Glasses combine some useful tech but I wouldn't describe them as 'smart' and they're in no way in the same league as the proper smartglasses from Google, Sony and others with heads-up displays. Really, the Spardar Smart Glasses are a Bluetooth headset combined with a mediocre camera and quite dim torch, plus the not very well executed driving safety features. For £40, that's a reasonable amount of tech, but we'd advise spending that money elsewhere for now. Proper smartglasses will be worth the wait, and you'll have a bit of time to save up in preparation for the final public versions.",,,

How much it actually helps gaming is moot, since we’ve seen Nvidia GTX 970M run as fast or faster in laptops with mobile-class chips. Besides benchmark-busing results, Skylake also means state-of-the-art connectivity like Thunderbolt 3. As a workstation – gaming or CAD – the chassis and top components make a powerhouse with real performance to spare.

Here's our Vector Watch Luna review.","It's good to see a company approaching the smartwatch differently and we like the design and style of the Vector Watch Luna. A month-long battery life is a real standout point but you'll have to be happy with the retro low-res display as a sacrifice. This is all acceptable but the device falls down when it comes to functionality with poor apps, fitness tracking and notification system.

Boasting new 3D Touch technology and an improved camera, the iPhone 6s Plus looks absolutely amazing – but how does it compare to its predecessor, the original Apple phablet, the iPhone 6 Plus?","Based on the spec, we’d have to opt for the iPhone 6s Plus – the introduction of 3D Touch and an improved camera are both major plus points for the phone, and that’s without mentioning the upgraded A9 processor and 2GB of RAM. However, with this being said, if you’re not as excited about the iPhone 6s Plus’ 3D Touch display and improved camera as we are, the iPhone 6 Plus is still a fantastic phone and can compete with many 2015 flagship phones.

Although we like the capless USB port and better front facing camera, it's simply far too similar to the Xperia Z3 to justify an upgrade – perhaps owners of older generations will be more tempted. It doesn't help that the firm is alienating customers by launching the same phone in Japan as the Xperia Z4. The biggest issue is how hot the phone gets when it's pushed sometimes resulting in apps being closed down which so we recommend waiting for the Xperia Z5.",,,

(They can also tell you when someone is calling your phone, a feature that's particularly useful.) What the UP3 is good at is monitoring your health and fitness, as well as motivating you to become better on both counts. Laying aside the problems I had with my test bands, the UP3 is a good tracker, made better by the recent hardware and software updates.

For exisitng owners, here's how to check whether your iPhone 6 Plus is affected by the camera recall.","When we initially wrote this review, the new size was something of an unknown. For many people the iPhone 6 (or iPhone 6S) is the better choice for the reasons we list in our iPhone 6 vs 6 Plus comparison. The truth is that a 5.5in screen isn't quite big enough to enable the 6 Plus to replace a tablet, yet the device is arguably too big and unwieldy as a smartphone. It will suit some people perfectly, especially if you watch a lot of video or play a lot of games, while others will quickly see that it's not for them: it won't fit in their jeans pocket and demands two-handed operation much of the time. One thing is for sure: the iPhone 6 Plus is still expensive. If you're keen to buy one right now, we'd recommend against the 16GB model. And that leaves the 64GB at £619, but if you're already spending this much money, you may as well spend an extra £80 and get the 64GB iPhone 6S Plus. Or, if you can live with a smaller screen, the 64GB iPhone 6S also costs £619. Of course, there is another option: used or refurbished. If you can find a 64GB model at a good price in the refurbished section of Apple's website, it could be a tempting deal compared to the 6S or 6S Plus.",,,

Even beginners will be able to fly it, and there are good safety features to prevent the Phantom flying away, as well as landing when the battery is low.

If low power consumption is a must, then the 960 is an obvious buy at this price - it really is astoundingly efficient compared to the competition. However, if you're more interested in raw figures, it's a harder decision. It's a bit cheaper than the 280X, but about 2-3fps down on speed. Likewise, it's a similar amount more expensive than the 285, this time being 2-3fps faster. At this pricing, there's very little to choose between them, although the 960's lower power consumption will make it rather better value than either once you take running costs into account. That, added to HEVC support, makes this marginally the best card at this price point, in our opinion.",,,

We compare the specs of market-leading Android tablets, including the Amazon Fire HD 10, Google Nexus 9, Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 9.7 and Sony Xperia Z4 Tablet.","Which of these tablets is best for you is very much dependent on your individual needs. At £169.99 the Fire HD 10 is by far the cheapest, but the reason why is clear when you compare its specification against the other three tablets here, plus consider the fact you can't install apps from Google Play. Technically speaking the Sony Xperia Z4 Tablet is the best tablet in our round-up - it's the fastest, it has the best screen, excellent audio, some great extras such as a waterproof chassis and PS4 Remote Play, and more. It's also by far the most expensive. If money's no issue then great, go for the Sony. But Samsung's Galaxy Tab S2 9.7in is an incredibly close second-best that's available for much less money at around £320 (putting it in direct competition with the iPad Air, but we'd go for the Tab S2 over Apple's tablet every time). It also boasts a fingerprint scanner, a brilliant screen and very strong performance. We can't ignore the Nexus 9 for the sheer value it offers - an outstanding deal at £225.

See what we make of it in our full review after it was premiered at CES 2016.,"The TabPro S is undeniably a beautiful and capable piece of hardware and it can be a joy to use. The problem is, it’s not a joy to use all the time. The 2-in-1 form factor can work, and we still think that the Surface Pro 4 is the best example of this, thanks to its build quality and integrated kickstand. The TabPro S is an excellent computer, but it remains frustrating that it doesn’t always excel in being one. Hopefully Samsung will consider improving simple things like the stand on the inevitable sequel if it is to continue to charge this much money for it.",,,$520

Any resemblance is mostly visual, though.
Superficial parts of the build are worse, the screen is nowhere near as good and the trackpad is typical slightly annoying Windows laptop fodder. It’s definitely not the perfect laptop.
However, in terms of providing a solid gaming experience for your cash, it’s a decent buy. The GTX 960M GPU hits the sweet spot, where it cam handle demanding games at reasonable settings without costing as much as a second-hand car. One you’d actually want to drive, anyway.
Screen quality is a sticking point at this price. Apparently £900 isn’t enough to have an IPS screen, even though previous GL552 models (and current ones in other countries) use such a panel.

The overall sound signature has a good presentation, but is severely let down by its closed soundstage, making the headphones sound clustered.

Read our Finow X5 review.","At £100 the Finow X5 sounds - and looks - like a great smartwatch. Unfortunately, a lack of app support (at least without Google Play as it was supplied to us) makes it unappealing for use in place of a smartphone, and it just doesn’t function very well as a companion device.

However, there's no escaping the high price and limited selection of apps. And if you're not interested in gaming, you're just as well off buying a 3rd-generation Apple TV or Roku for less than half the price. Competition from other gaming media streamers is stiff, too, with Amazon's £79 Fire TV offering more UK catch-up TV as well as similar gaming performance, expandable storage and support for 4K content.

We compare the new iPad with the Surface Pro 3 and 4 and spot the differences to help you choose.","When we reviewed the Surface Pro 3 we concluded that it was the best yet. It's the most portable of laptops and an acceptable tablet. Nothing has changed with the update to Windows 10. The Surface Pro 4 is an evolution and, apart from the higher screen resolution (and better-quality screen) and new processors, doesn't offer too many compelling reasons to buy one over the cheaper Pro 3, or upgrade if you already have one. With the iPad Pro, it's the best yet in some ways - it's the most powerful iPad and has the biggest, highest resolution screen - but it may not be the best choice for everyone who wants an iPad. It’s fantastic if you need to sketch, draw and paint, or if you simply want a bigger screen. It’s almost the opposite of the Surface Pro: a fantastic tablet and an acceptable laptop. Almost, because it’s stretching the truth to call the Surface a fantastic laptop. It does an admirable job, and is certainly a better laptop than iPad Pro, but you can buy a better laptop than the Surface Pro 4 for less money. If you can live with a sub-10in screen, the brand new iPad Pro is a cheaper option (although not 'cheap' by the time you've added the keyboard and Pencil), and has better cameras than the bigger iPad Pro.",,,From $799

The storyline, although interesting doesn’t last for nearly as long as the Human Revolution campaign, even with a sprinkling of fairly interesting and varied side missions and the button layout is just a bit too different to other first person shooters to make it a game you can just pick up and play without a serious learning curve.

But all iOS 10-capable iPhones and iPads will get the big app updates, and Memories in Photos, plus the huge update to Messages are well worth having. Of course, this is just the start for iOS 10. App developers will be adding support for Siri, and plenty more Homekit gadgets will go on sale over the next 12 months to use with the new Home app. Apps will also arrive for the iMessage app store, so while you’re free to stick with iOS 9, you will miss out on quite a few fun features. Performance on the oldest devices remains to be seen, so if you have an iPhone 5 or 5C, or iPad mini 2 or iPad 4 it’s probably worth holding on until other people take the risk for you. If the general consensus is that these devices can cope with iOS 10, that’s the time to hit the Install button.

Its 4K screen is stunning if you don’t mind ultra-energetic Adobe RGB-style colours and while battery stamina isn’t amazing, it roughly matches the new MacBook with OLED touch panel. It’s a shame the cost of making this a home gaming laptop with the Core attachment is quite so high, but the Razer Blade Stealth convinces as a pure and simple ultra-light style laptop too. Black is back for everyone tired of brushed aluminium and “rose gold”. We’d recommend buying the cheaper version than we’re actually reviewing unless you absolutely need loads of ultra-fast storage and a 4K display.

Here’s our Huawei MediaPad M3 review.","In a stagnated market, the Huawei MediaPad M3 initially feels a little underwhelming. After extended use though, we reckon it’s a cut above the mid-range, but then again at this price you are paying for it. It’s a good alternative to an iPad if you want an Android tablet that’s bigger than an iPad mini but smaller than an iPad Air 2. But, who is specifically looking for that? The MediaPad is excellent and we recommend it, but it lacks a certain ‘wow’ factor that's largely down to the high number of existing Android tablets. The MediaPad 3 is a cut above, but you should also consider Samsung’s Galaxy Tab series for a similarly excellent Android tablet experience.",,,$299

We review the Microsoft Band 2.,"It is very difficult to score the Band 2, because it is such a specific product with a unique feature set. But let's unpack it: it is definitely good value, as the combination of sensors and features is much greater than any comparable product at this price. And it is well made if not the last word in elegance, nor with perfect battery life. If you are looking for a GPS runner's or cyclist's watch it is a good one at a good price, and it also offers the productivity and sleep tracking. And if you want a smartwatch you will like what the Band 2 does, but you may hanker after the ability to compose and send messages. Simply, I don't. I like to wear my dumb watch, and I like for my phone to stay in my pocket rather than on my wrist. So for me the Band 2 is a winner.

But it's back with this, the security minded DTEK50. Here's our BlackBerry DTEK50 review.","The BlackBerry DTEK50 is a good phone. Above average, even. But we can’t fully recommend it because of the way BlackBerry is marketing it. The perhaps incorrect status quo is that people don’t want to worry about security; they just want a phone that works. Security flaws on huge scales are largely down to external database hacks, not device vulnerabilities.

The hype won’t last forever, and one day soon only the most die-hard PokéHunters will continue to play, but expect it to be among the first of many more augmented-reality apps coming your way. Despite the safety concerns and the huge amount of criticism it has received as Niantic struggles to deal with the huge demand, Pokémon GO is deserving of real credit for getting a nation off the sofa and into the great outdoors.

Since we're disappointed in the camera (with no noticeable difference), it's not worth paying the extra money to get a fingerprint scanner which can't even be used with Android Pay since there's no NFC.

We recommend the XA if you want a sleek, smart, mid-range phone that does everything acceptably well. If you get it on contract it’ll be about £20 per month, so for about half the price of a 2016 flagship. It’s solid, but we are strangely still waiting for Sony’s world-beater.

The issues regarding the occasional grainy mid tones and harsh audio ruin an otherwise decent audio experience, and although it’s not present with every song we listened to, it happened regularly enough for it to be noticeable and isn’t something we’d expect at this price range. However, the earphones were designed to be wireless, portable and discreet and in these areas, the H5 wireless is a winner – it’s lightweight at 18g and the use of magnets to transform the earphones into a necklace when not in use is a great feature.",,,

It’s very well-made, the keyboard is great and the frame has some connections you sometimes only see in a laptop dock.
However, its omission of a memory card slot is odd, the fan system is fairly loud and while hardcore gamers may appreciate the use of (in some models) a TN display it doesn’t do pure image quality many favours. As usual with an Alienware machine, you can find similar specs for less money from value-driven alternatives from, for example, PC Specialist and the HP Omen range.

If you have an older PC with an Ivy Bridge (third-generation) or Haswell (fourth-generation) processor, then it could be time to upgrade – unless it was the top-of-the-range Core i7, in which case you might not notice much of a performance boost.
However, things are more complicated now that AMD has released Ryzen. The top models have eight cores and 16 threads, and have proven themselves not only faster than Intel’s current best (the i7-7700K) in many CPU-based benchmarks, but they’re also great value too.

Its highs and lows are marked. Don’t expect the quality of the Surface Pro 4 for less than half the price. While build isn’t dramatically reduced, general performance is. It’s the same old issue with Windows 10 laptops that have Atom processors, making the Asus Transformer Mini T102HA much slower than a Chromebook or Android hybrid. It’s the price of Windows 10 flexibility. However, if you can accept the slower feel, common to everything that runs Windows 10 using an Atom CPU, then the T102HA is a handy little machine.

If you need a computer you’ll use extensively most days, though, we’d strongly advise getting one with an Intel Core i3 CPU rather than the Intel Pentium used here. While it’s the “next best” option, it is noticeably slower, regardless of what you’re doing. If £300, or even £400, is your max budget you also have to accept that you won’t get a dazzling screen.
